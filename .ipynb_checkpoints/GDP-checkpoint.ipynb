    "### Macroeconomic theory: GDP\n",
    "According to Investopedia, \"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period,\" whether annually or quarterly. By the expenditure approach, the Gross Domestic Product is the sum of government expenditures, private investment, consumer expenditure, and net exports (exports minus imports). This can be expressed as **`GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "From class, we learned that in the United States, consumption dominates GDP. Additionally, the United States typically maintains an international current account deficit and surplus in the financial markets - we import more than we export, so our net exports are negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Macroeconomic theory: The Crowding Out Effect of Keynes\n",
    "In Maynard Keynes's economic theory on fiscal policy, the federal government can combat recessions by an expansionary fiscal policy, whereby government spending increases aggregate demand and therefore equilibrium real GDP and price level while decreasing unemployment. In inflationary times, the federal government can institute contractionary fiscal policy, cutting spending or raising taxes. This decreases aggregate demand and thus equilibrium real GDP and price level (combating inflation).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, government deficit spending is funded by the issuing of federal bonds, or debt. As the government sells more bonds, or increases the supply of treasury securities, the equilibrium price of bonds must fall and the interest rate must rise. With a higher interest rate, both businesses interested in investment and consumers borrowing money for consumption are less able to borrow funds. In effect, **increasing government spending _crowds out_ private investment and consumption**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneously, higher interest rates attract foreign investment in the domestic market. This causes the domestic currency to appreciate in the international exchange rate markets. As a consequence, **increased goverment spending decreases exports and increases imports**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Crowding out Effect of Keynes** explains that instituting Keynesian fiscal policy actually has the opposite of the desired effect, decreasing GDP in a longer term due to interest rate effects."
